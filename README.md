Meshing is a very essential step in any numerical analysis. In this code I show you how to create a 2D triangular meshing to any 2D closed surface. The code takes in the surface as closed boundary lines descriped by as many boundary points as the user wants and then the code creates the meshing with very high speed. You can control the accuracy of meshing as explained in the video. This code can be very helpful in any numerical analysis requiring a meshing step like solving PDEs and calculating many physical properties for any geometry.
